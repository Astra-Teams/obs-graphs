# Quantum Computing

Quantum computing uses quantum-mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement.

## Core Principles

- **Qubits**: Quantum bits that can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously
- **Superposition**: Multiple states at once
- **Entanglement**: Correlated quantum states

## Applications

- Cryptography
- Drug discovery
- Optimization problems
