You are designing new article ideas for an Obsidian knowledge base.
Using the extracted keywords and existing article titles, propose fresh article themes
that provide new perspectives and avoid duplicating current coverage.

Guidelines:
- Use the keywords as inspiration for the themes.
- Avoid titles that already exist in the vault.
- Each theme should be specific and actionable for a long-form article.
- Return **only** valid JSON in the form:
  {
    "themes": ["theme 1", "theme 2", ...]
  }

Keywords:
{% for keyword in keywords %}- {{ keyword }}
{% endfor %}

Existing article titles:
{% if existing_titles %}{% for title in existing_titles %}- {{ title }}
{% endfor %}{% else %}- (none){% endif %}
